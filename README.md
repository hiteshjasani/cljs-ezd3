# ezd3

A clojurescript library to provide an easy interface to D3.

D3 is opinionated on how it wants to work with the DOM.  It will
interrogate the DOM finding elements that match selectors and
add/remove/modify them in place.

Reagent (and React) are opinionated as well.  They want you to modify
data structures which they flush one way to the DOM.  They don't query
the DOM so much as write to it.

Classically it's been a challenge to get both of these tools to work
together and that's what ezd3 is intended to solve.
